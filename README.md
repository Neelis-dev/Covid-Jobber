# Covid-Jobber
A free application for everyone to download and easily find shorttime jobs in times of the pandemic.

This projects is made with AndroidStudio and Java as language.

Important Comments: 

1. If you change your location it is necessary to request the location once for example in Google Maps because Covid-Jobber uses the "LastLocation" that was recognized.

2. Don't wonder if the location is Germany sometimes and not more detailed. That is because the data that we get from the API is not that precise in some cases. 

3.

Have fun with our app!
